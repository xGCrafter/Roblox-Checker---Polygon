# Roblox Checker Tool

A tool to check Roblox accounts for valid and invalid accounts. Has features such as premium and robux checker.

## Overview
This tool allows you to check Roblox accounts using a list of username:password combinations (`combo.txt`) and proxies (`proxies.txt`). It includes a license key system to ensure only authorized users can access the tool. The tool is distributed as a pre-built executable, so you donâ€™t need to install Python or any dependencies to run it. You can buy it from our discord server!

New Feature: CAPTCHA SOLVER (BETA!)
